## Epic 1: World Bank Data Access via MCP Server

Users can search, retrieve, and explore World Bank Data360 climate and development indicators through MCP tools. The MCP server is standalone, testable in Claude Desktop via stdio, and production-ready via HTTP Streamable.

### Story 1.1: Project Setup and Configuration

As a developer,
I want to initialize the Data360 Voice project with all dependencies and configuration,
So that I have a working development environment to build the MCP server.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a clean development environment
**When** running `uv init data360-voice && cd data360-voice && uv add fastmcp httpx`
**Then** the project is created with pyproject.toml containing all MCP server dependencies
**And** the project structure includes `mcp_server/__init__.py`, `mcp_server/server.py`, `mcp_server/data360_client.py`, `mcp_server/config.py`
**And** `mcp_server/config.py` contains base URL (`https://data360api.worldbank.org`), timeout settings, and pagination limits (1000 per page, 5000 cap)
**And** `.env.example` documents all required environment variables
**And** `.gitignore` excludes `.env`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`
**And** `tests/mcp_server/__init__.py` directory structure exists

### Story 1.2: Data360 API Client with Error Handling

As a developer,
I want an async HTTP client that wraps the World Bank Data360 API with retry logic and structured error handling,
So that all MCP tools have a reliable, consistent way to call the API.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the `data360_client.py` module
**When** making a successful API call to any Data360 endpoint
**Then** the client maps Python snake_case parameters to API UPPERCASE parameters (e.g., `database_id` -> `DATABASE_ID`)
**And** the response preserves all API field names exactly (`DATA_SOURCE`, `COMMENT_TS`, `OBS_VALUE`, etc.)
**And** the client uses httpx.AsyncClient with configurable timeout

**Given** a Data360 API call that returns a 429 or 5xx error
**When** the client processes the response
**Then** it retries with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, max 3 attempts)
**And** if all retries fail, returns a structured error: `{"success": False, "error": "<message>", "error_type": "api_error"}`

**Given** a Data360 API call that returns a 4xx client error (not 429)
**When** the client processes the response
**Then** it does NOT retry and returns a structured error immediately

**Given** a request for data with more than 1000 records
**When** the client fetches data
**Then** it auto-paginates using the `skip` parameter in increments of 1000
**And** it stops at 5000 records total and sets `truncated: True` in the response

**Given** any API interaction
**When** logging is invoked
**Then** the client uses `logging.getLogger(__name__)` (no print statements)
**And** logs API request/response details at DEBUG level, failures at ERROR level

### Story 1.3: Search Indicators MCP Tool

As a user querying World Bank data,
I want to search for relevant indicators using natural language,
So that I can find the right data indicators for my climate or development questions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the MCP server is running
**When** a user calls `search_indicators(query="drought Brazil")`
**Then** the tool calls POST `/data360/searchv2` with `{"search": "drought Brazil", "top": 10, "skip": 0}`
**And** returns `{"success": True, "data": [...], "total_count": N, "returned_count": M, "truncated": False}`
**And** each result includes indicator ID, name, database_id, and description

**Given** a search with optional parameters
**When** calling `search_indicators(query="CO2 emissions", top=5, filter="...")`
**Then** the tool passes all parameters correctly to the API

**Given** a search that returns no results
**When** the tool processes the empty response
**Then** it returns `{"success": True, "data": [], "total_count": 0, "returned_count": 0, "truncated": False}`

**Given** the Data360 API is unavailable
**When** the tool is called
**Then** it returns `{"success": False, "error": "<descriptive message>", "error_type": "api_error"}`

### Story 1.4: Get Data MCP Tool

As a user exploring climate data,
I want to retrieve actual data values for specific indicators by country and time period,
So that I can see the numbers behind climate and development trends.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the MCP server is running
**When** a user calls `get_data(database_id="WB_WDI", indicator="WB_WDI_EN_ATM_CO2E_KT", ref_area="BRA")`
**Then** the tool calls GET `/data360/data` with the mapped UPPERCASE parameters
**And** returns data including `OBS_VALUE`, `DATA_SOURCE`, `COMMENT_TS`, `TIME_PERIOD`, `LATEST_DATA`, `INDICATOR`, `REF_AREA`
**And** all API field names are preserved exactly as returned

**Given** a query with time period filters
**When** calling `get_data(database_id="WB_WDI", indicator="...", time_period_from="2015", time_period_to="2023")`
**Then** the tool passes `timePeriodFrom` and `timePeriodTo` parameters correctly

**Given** a query that returns more than 1000 records
**When** the tool fetches data
**Then** it auto-paginates internally (via data360_client.py) up to 5000 records
**And** returns `total_count` from the API so the LLM knows if data was truncated

**Given** no data exists for the requested indicator/country combination
**When** the tool processes the response
**Then** it returns `{"success": True, "data": [], "total_count": 0, "returned_count": 0, "truncated": False}`

### Story 1.5: Get Metadata, List Indicators, and Get Disaggregation MCP Tools

As a user exploring World Bank data,
I want to access indicator metadata, browse available indicators per dataset, and check disaggregation dimensions,
So that I can understand what data is available and how it's structured.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the MCP server is running
**When** a user calls `get_metadata(query="&$filter=series_description/idno eq 'WB_WDI_SP_POP_TOTL'")`
**Then** the tool calls POST `/data360/metadata` with the OData query
**And** returns indicator metadata including description, topics, and data sources

**Given** the MCP server is running
**When** a user calls `list_indicators(dataset_id="WB_WDI")`
**Then** the tool calls GET `/data360/indicators?datasetId=WB_WDI`
**And** returns all available indicators for that dataset

**Given** the MCP server is running
**When** a user calls `get_disaggregation(dataset_id="WB_WDI", indicator_id="WB_WDI_SP_POP_TOTL")`
**Then** the tool calls GET `/data360/disaggregation` with the correct parameters
**And** returns available disaggregation dimensions (SEX, AGE, URBANISATION, etc.)

**Given** any of these three tools encounters an API error
**When** the error is processed
**Then** the tool returns a structured error response following the standard format
**And** never raises an exception

### Story 1.6: Dual Transport and Claude Desktop Testing

As a developer,
I want the MCP server to work via both stdio (Claude Desktop) and HTTP Streamable (production) transports,
So that I can test locally in Claude Desktop and deploy for web access without code changes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the MCP server with all 5 tools implemented
**When** running `fastmcp dev mcp_server/server.py`
**Then** the MCP Inspector opens and all 5 tools are visible and callable

**Given** the MCP server configured for stdio transport
**When** installed via `fastmcp install mcp_server/server.py`
**Then** Claude Desktop can use all 5 tools to query World Bank data end-to-end

**Given** the MCP server configured for HTTP Streamable transport
**When** started in HTTP mode
**Then** the server accepts MCP client connections over HTTP
**And** all 5 tools work identically to stdio mode

**Given** any transport mode
**When** tools are called
**Then** tool logic is identical, only the transport layer differs (handled by FastMCP)
**And** NFR12 (transport-agnostic) is satisfied

### Story 1.7: MCP Server Test Suite

As a developer,
I want automated tests for the MCP server and API client,
So that I can verify correctness and catch regressions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the test suite in `tests/mcp_server/`
**When** running `uv run pytest tests/mcp_server/`
**Then** all tests pass

**Given** `tests/mcp_server/fixtures/` with sample API responses
**When** `test_data360_client.py` runs
**Then** it tests parameter mapping (snake_case to UPPERCASE)
**And** tests auto-pagination logic
**And** tests retry behavior on 429/5xx errors
**And** tests no-retry on 4xx errors
**And** tests structured error response format

**Given** `test_server.py`
**When** MCP tool integration tests run
**Then** each of the 5 tools is tested with mocked API responses
**And** tests verify the consistent response format (success/error structure)
**And** tests verify API field names are preserved (DATA_SOURCE, COMMENT_TS, etc.)

---

## Epic 2: Conversational Climate Data Interface

Users can ask climate and development questions in natural language via a Chainlit chat interface and receive streaming, data-backed narrative responses with multi-turn conversation support and session persistence.

### Story 2.1: Chainlit + FastAPI Application Setup

As a developer,
I want to set up the web application with Chainlit mounted in FastAPI and PostgreSQL for persistence,
So that users have a chat interface to interact with the system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the existing project with MCP server
**When** adding web application dependencies (`uv add chainlit fastapi uvicorn asyncpg`)
**Then** `app/main.py` creates a FastAPI app with Chainlit mounted via `mount_chainlit`
**And** `app/config.py` loads environment variables for Claude API key, database connection, and MCP server URL
**And** `.chainlit/config.toml` is generated via `chainlit init`
**And** running `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` starts the full application

**Given** the application is running
**When** a user opens the browser
**Then** the Chainlit chat interface loads in under 2 seconds
**And** environment variables are used for all secrets (NFR5, NFR6)
**And** all external API communication uses HTTPS (NFR7)

### Story 2.2: MCP Client Integration with Claude Tool Use

As a user,
I want my natural language questions to be processed by Claude using the MCP server tools,
So that my questions are answered with real World Bank data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the Chainlit app is running with MCP client connected to the MCP server
**When** a user types "What are CO2 emissions in Brazil?"
**Then** Chainlit sends the message to Claude API with MCP tools available
**And** Claude selects appropriate tools (search_indicators, then get_data)
**And** tool calls are displayed as intermediate steps in the Chainlit UI
**And** the final response contains data from the World Bank Data360 API

**Given** the MCP server is connected via HTTP Streamable transport
**When** tool calls are made
**Then** the MCP client (Chainlit native handlers: `@cl.on_mcp_connect`, `@cl.on_mcp_disconnect`) manages the connection
**And** tool results flow back to Claude for response generation

**Given** the Data360 API is unavailable
**When** a tool call fails
**Then** the structured error response is passed to Claude
**And** Claude narrates the failure transparently to the user (NFR9)

### Story 2.3: Streaming Responses

As a user,
I want to see the AI's response appear word-by-word in real time,
So that I don't have to wait for the full response before seeing results.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user sends a question
**When** Claude generates a response
**Then** tokens stream to the UI via Socket.IO (Chainlit's WebSocket)
**And** the first token appears within 3 seconds for uncached queries (NFR1)
**And** the full response completes within 15 seconds for uncached queries (NFR2)

**Given** Claude is making tool calls before responding
**When** tool call status changes
**Then** intermediate steps are displayed (e.g., "Searching indicators...", "Fetching data...")
**And** the user sees progress before the narrative response begins

### Story 2.4: Narrative Response Generation

As a journalist or researcher,
I want data presented as contextual narratives describing values, trends, and comparisons,
So that I can understand and use the data without interpreting raw numbers.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user asks "How has drought increased in Brazil in the last decade?"
**When** Claude receives data from MCP tools
**Then** the response describes data values in human-readable narrative form (FR13)
**And** includes trend descriptions (rising, falling, stable, accelerating) when time-series data is available (FR15)

**Given** a user asks "Compare CO2 emissions between Brazil and India"
**When** Claude processes multi-country data
**Then** the response compares data across the requested countries in a single narrative (FR14)

**Given** data has missing years or gaps
**When** Claude generates the response
**Then** it flags the gaps transparently (e.g., "Data not available for 2021-2022") (FR16)

**Given** no matching indicator exists for the query
**When** Claude processes the empty result
**Then** it responds clearly with "No relevant data found" and suggests alternative queries if appropriate (FR17)

### Story 2.5: Multi-Turn Conversation Support

As a user,
I want to ask follow-up questions that build on my previous questions,
So that I can explore data progressively without repeating context.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user asked "What are CO2 emissions in Brazil?" and received an answer
**When** the user follows up with "How does that compare to Argentina?"
**Then** Claude uses the conversation context to understand "that" refers to CO2 emissions (FR7)
**And** the response provides the comparison without the user needing to re-specify the indicator

**Given** a multi-turn conversation
**When** multiple tool calls are made across turns
**Then** each response maintains coherent context with previous answers

### Story 2.6: Conversation Persistence and History

As a user,
I want my conversations saved so I can return to them later,
So that I don't lose my research progress between sessions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the Chainlit datalayer configured with PostgreSQL
**When** a user has a conversation
**Then** the conversation history is persisted to the database (FR27)

**Given** a user returns to the application
**When** they open the interface
**Then** they can start a new conversation (FR28)
**And** they can access previous conversations from the sidebar (FR29)

**Given** PostgreSQL is the persistence backend
**When** the application starts
**Then** it connects using credentials from environment variables (NFR6)
**And** the shared connection pool is used by both FastAPI and Chainlit

---

## Epic 3: Trust, Citations & LLM Grounding

Every data response carries verifiable World Bank sources with publication-ready citations. The LLM grounding boundary is enforced architecturally, preventing hallucination of data, causal explanations, predictions, or external knowledge.

### Story 3.1: System Prompt for LLM Grounding Boundary

As a product owner,
I want the LLM strictly constrained to narrate only data returned by the API,
So that users can trust every claim in the response is backed by official World Bank data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the system prompt in `app/chat.py`
**When** Claude receives data from MCP tools
**Then** it narrates only the data values, trends, and comparisons present in the tool results (FR18)
**And** it never adds causal explanations not present in the API data (FR19)
**And** it never generates predictions or forecasts (FR20)
**And** it never adds external knowledge or editorial judgment (FR21)

**Given** a user asks "Why did CO2 emissions increase in Brazil?"
**When** Claude processes the question
**Then** it responds that it can report what the World Bank indicators show but cannot explain causation beyond what the data contains (FR22)

**Given** a user pushes for opinions or predictions
**When** Claude processes the follow-up
**Then** it maintains the grounding boundary and redirects to what the data shows

### Story 3.2: DATA_SOURCE Citation on Every Response

As a journalist,
I want every data point to include its World Bank source attribution,
So that I can cite it in my publications with confidence.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** Claude generates a response containing data values
**When** the response is displayed
**Then** every data point includes the `CITATION_SOURCE` field (derived from `DATA_SOURCE` when present, or `database_name` from search cache) (FR8)
**And** the citation source is extracted from the API, not generated by the LLM
**And** the indicator code is displayed alongside the source (FR12)

**Given** a response with multiple data points
**When** data comes from different sources
**Then** each data point carries its own individual source attribution

**Given** the system prompt instructions
**When** Claude formats citations
**Then** they are in publication-ready format suitable for direct use in articles and reports (FR9)

### Story 3.3: Data Freshness Transparency

As a researcher,
I want to see the most recent data year for every data point and be warned about stale data,
So that I understand the recency of the information I'm using.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** Claude generates a response with data
**When** the response is displayed
**Then** every data point shows the most recent data year available (FR10)
**And** the year is extracted from `TIME_PERIOD` / `LATEST_DATA` fields in the API response

**Given** data where the most recent year is more than 2 years old
**When** the response is generated
**Then** Claude includes an explicit warning about data staleness (FR11)
**And** the warning distinguishes between "this is the latest available" vs "more recent data may exist"

**Given** a multi-country comparison where data years differ
**When** the response is generated
**Then** each country's data year is shown individually
**And** discrepancies in data recency are flagged transparently

## Epic 4: Fact-Check & Claim Verification

Users can paste a climate or data claim and receive a data-grounded verdict (supported, not supported, partially supported) with World Bank source citations, enabling rapid fact-checking workflows.

### Story 4.1: Claim Input and Indicator Identification

As a fact-checker,
I want to paste a climate claim and have the system identify the relevant data indicators,
So that verification starts automatically from my input.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user pastes "Brazil's deforestation dropped 50% since 2020"
**When** the system processes the input
**Then** Claude identifies this as a claim to verify (FR23)
**And** uses `search_indicators` to find relevant forest/deforestation indicators (FR24)
**And** uses `get_data` to retrieve Brazil's data for the relevant time period

**Given** a claim about a topic with no matching indicators
**When** the system searches for data
**Then** it responds transparently that no relevant data was found to verify the claim
**And** provides whatever partial data is available (e.g., country-level vs. the requested regional level)

### Story 4.2: Verdict Generation with Source Citations

As a fact-checker,
I want a clear verdict on whether a claim is supported by official data,
So that I can publish a fact-check with confidence in under 15 seconds.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the system has retrieved relevant data for a claim
**When** generating the verdict
**Then** it calculates actual values and compares them against the claimed values (FR25)
**And** returns a clear verdict: "supported", "not supported", or "partially supported" (FR26)
**And** includes full CITATION_SOURCE citations for every data point used in the verdict

**Given** a claim like "Brazil's deforestation dropped 50% since 2020"
**When** the verdict is generated
**Then** the response shows the actual data values, the calculated percentage change, and how it compares to the claimed 50%
**And** includes the exact indicator code, data source, and years used

**Given** the claim is partially correct (e.g., direction is right but magnitude is wrong)
**When** the verdict is generated
**Then** the response provides a "partially supported" verdict explaining what is correct and what isn't
**And** all claims are grounded exclusively in API data (no external knowledge, per the grounding boundary)

**Given** the full fact-check flow
**When** measuring end-to-end time
**Then** the verdict with sources is delivered in under 15 seconds (per success criteria)

## Epic 5: Offline Local Indicator Discovery

Users can instantly discover and search World Bank indicators without any API call, enabling faster workflows and resilience when the Data360 API is slow or unavailable. A curated set of climate-focused popular indicators provides an opinionated starting point.

**FRs covered:** FR37, FR38, FR39, FR40
**NFRs addressed:** NFR13 (offline search <50ms), NFR14 (startup load <500ms)

### Story 5.1: Popular Indicators Data File

As a developer,
I want a curated JSON file of ~25-30 popular climate and development indicators,
So that the MCP server can offer instant indicator discovery without API calls.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the file `mcp_server/popular_indicators.json`
**When** loaded by the MCP server
**Then** it contains ~25-30 indicators across 7 climate-weighted categories (Climate & Environment, Energy, Demographics, Economy, Health, Infrastructure, Agriculture & Land Use)
**And** each indicator has `category`, `code`, `name`, and `description` fields
**And** the category distribution is weighted toward climate/environment topics (at least 40% of indicators)
**And** indicator codes match the short codes used by the Data360 API (e.g. `EN_ATM_CO2E_KT`), which map to fully-qualified indicator IDs via the `{database}_{code}` convention (e.g. `WB_WDI_EN_ATM_CO2E_KT`)
**And** the JSON file loads in under 100ms

### Story 5.2: Metadata Indicators Data File

As a developer,
I want a comprehensive JSON file of ~1500 indicator metadata records,
So that users can search the full indicator catalog offline.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the file `mcp_server/metadata_indicators.json`
**When** loaded by the MCP server
**Then** it contains ~1500 indicator metadata records extracted from the Data360 API
**And** each record has `code`, `name`, `description`, and `source` fields
**And** the file loads into memory in under 500ms (NFR14)
**And** a script or documented process exists to regenerate this file from the live API

### Story 5.3: list_popular_indicators MCP Tool

As a user exploring World Bank data,
I want to see a curated list of popular climate and development indicators,
So that I can quickly discover relevant indicators without knowing exact codes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the MCP server is running
**When** a user calls `list_popular_indicators()`
**Then** the tool returns the curated indicator list from `popular_indicators.json` (FR37)
**And** no API call is made to the Data360 API
**And** the response follows the standard format: `{"success": True, "data": [...], "total_count": N, "returned_count": N, "truncated": False}`
**And** indicators are grouped by category in the response
**And** the response is returned in under 50ms (NFR13)

**Given** the MCP server has not yet loaded the popular indicators file
**When** `list_popular_indicators()` is called for the first time
**Then** the file is loaded once and cached in memory via the singleton pattern (FR40)
**And** subsequent calls reuse the cached data without re-reading the file

### Story 5.4: search_local_indicators MCP Tool

As a user querying World Bank data,
I want to search indicator metadata offline with instant results,
So that I can quickly find relevant indicators before making API calls.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the MCP server is running
**When** a user calls `search_local_indicators(query="CO2 emissions")`
**Then** the tool searches the local metadata cache using relevance scoring (FR38):
  - Exact code match: score 100
  - Code substring: score 90
  - Word in indicator name: score 80
  - Substring in indicator name: score 70
  - Substring in description: score 40
**And** returns results sorted by relevance score descending (FR39)
**And** the response includes: `{"success": True, "query": "CO2 emissions", "total_matches": N, "data": [...], "note": "Local search - instant results from cached metadata"}`
**And** each result includes `indicator`, `name`, `description` (truncated to 200 chars), `source` (truncated to 100 chars), and `relevance_score`
**And** the response is returned in under 50ms (NFR13)

**Given** `search_local_indicators(query="xyz", limit=5)`
**When** more than 5 results match
**Then** only the top 5 by relevance score are returned

**Given** a search with no matches
**When** the query doesn't match any indicator
**Then** the tool returns `{"success": True, "query": "xyz", "total_matches": 0, "data": [], "note": "No local matches found. Try search_indicators for API-based search."}`

**Given** the metadata file has not been loaded yet
**When** `search_local_indicators()` is called for the first time
**Then** the metadata file is loaded once and cached in memory (FR40)

### Story 5.5: Offline Indicator Search Test Suite

As a developer,
I want automated tests for the offline search tools and indicator cache,
So that I can verify correctness and catch regressions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the test suite in `tests/mcp_server/`
**When** running `uv run pytest tests/mcp_server/test_indicator_cache.py`
**Then** all tests pass

**Given** `test_indicator_cache.py`
**When** tests run
**Then** it tests relevance scoring (exact code match gets 100, code substring gets 90, etc.)
**And** tests result ordering (highest relevance first)
**And** tests limit parameter (returns at most `limit` results)
**And** tests empty query results
**And** tests singleton caching (file loaded only once across multiple calls)
**And** tests `list_popular_indicators` returns correct structure
**And** tests `search_local_indicators` returns correct response format

## Epic 6: Temporal Coverage Check

Users can check which years have data for a given indicator before requesting data, preventing failed API calls and enabling smarter data retrieval workflows.

**FRs covered:** FR41, FR42, FR43
**NFRs addressed:** NFR9 (graceful API failure), NFR12 (transport-agnostic)

### Story 6.1: get_temporal_coverage MCP Tool

As a user exploring climate data,
I want to check what years have data for an indicator before requesting data,
So that I can avoid failed API calls and know the data availability upfront.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the MCP server is running
**When** a user calls `get_temporal_coverage(indicator="WB_WDI_SP_POP_TOTL", database="WB_WDI")`
**Then** the tool calls the existing `get_metadata` endpoint via `data360_client.py` with OData filter: `"&$filter=series_description/idno eq 'WB_WDI_SP_POP_TOTL'"` (FR42)
**And** extracts `time_periods` from the `series_description` in the metadata response
**And** returns: `{"success": True, "start_year": 1960, "end_year": 2023, "latest_year": 2023, "available_years": [1960, 1961, ..., 2023]}`

**Given** the indicator has no temporal coverage data in the metadata
**When** the tool processes the response
**Then** it returns `{"success": True, "start_year": null, "end_year": null, "latest_year": null, "available_years": [], "note": "No temporal coverage data found for this indicator"}`

**Given** the Data360 API is unavailable
**When** the tool is called
**Then** it returns the standard error format: `{"success": False, "error": "<descriptive message>", "error_type": "api_error"}`

**Given** the tool docstring
**When** Claude reads the tool description
**Then** the description recommends the 3-step workflow: `search_indicators → get_temporal_coverage → get_data` (FR43)

### Story 6.2: Temporal Coverage Test Suite

As a developer,
I want automated tests for the temporal coverage tool,
So that I can verify correct metadata extraction and error handling.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the test suite in `tests/mcp_server/`
**When** running temporal coverage tests
**Then** all tests pass

**Given** `test_temporal_coverage.py`
**When** tests run
**Then** it tests successful year extraction from mocked metadata response
**And** tests empty coverage scenario (no time_periods in metadata)
**And** tests API error handling (returns structured error)
**And** tests that the tool uses `data360_client.py` (not direct HTTP calls)
**And** tests response format matches the standard structure

## Epic 7: MCP Prompts & Resources

The MCP server provides guided workflow prompts and discoverable resources that help LLM clients execute common data analysis patterns (country comparisons, profiles, trend analysis) with consistent quality and proper citations.

**FRs covered:** FR44, FR45, FR46, FR47, FR48
**NFRs addressed:** NFR12 (transport-agnostic)

### Story 7.1: MCP Prompt Definitions

I want guided workflow prompts for common analysis patterns,
So that I get comprehensive, well-structured results with proper citations every time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the MCP server is running
**When** a client lists available prompts
**Then** three prompts are available: `compare_countries`, `country_profile`, `trend_analysis`

**Given** a user invokes `compare_countries(indicator="CO2 emissions", countries="Brazil, India, Germany")`
**When** the prompt is rendered
**Then** it returns a 4-step instruction guiding: search indicator → check coverage → retrieve data → present ranked markdown table (FR44)
**And** the instructions specify DATA_SOURCE citations for every data point

**Given** a user invokes `country_profile(country="Brazil")`
**When** the prompt is rendered
**Then** it returns instructions to retrieve 7 key climate and development indicators: population, GDP, GDP per capita, CO2 emissions, forest area, renewable energy, electricity access (FR45)
**And** instructions include checking temporal coverage for each indicator
**And** the output format is a structured summary with DATA_SOURCE citations

**Given** a user invokes `trend_analysis(indicator="deforestation", country="Brazil", start_year="2010", end_year="2023")`
**When** the prompt is rendered
**Then** it returns a 5-step instruction guiding: search → coverage → retrieve → filter years → analyze trend pattern (FR46)
**And** trend pattern analysis includes direction (rising/falling/stable), rate (accelerating/decelerating/linear), and inflection points
**And** the output format includes a markdown data table and narrative description

**Given** default parameters for `trend_analysis`
**When** `start_year` and `end_year` are not specified
**Then** they default to "2010" and "2023" respectively

### Story 7.2: MCP Resource Definitions

As a developer or LLM client,
I want discoverable resources that document available databases and recommended workflows,
So that I can use the MCP server effectively without reading external documentation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the MCP server is running
**When** a client lists available resources
**Then** three resources are available: `data360://popular-indicators`, `data360://databases`, `data360://workflow` (FR47, FR48)

**Given** a client reads `data360://popular-indicators`
**When** the resource is returned
**Then** it contains the curated popular indicators JSON from `popular_indicators.json`
**And** indicators are categorized and include code, name, and description

**Given** a client reads `data360://databases`
**When** the resource is returned
**Then** it lists 4 World Bank databases: WB_WDI, WB_HNP, WB_GDF, WB_IDS
**And** each database includes `id`, `name`, and `description`

**Given** a client reads `data360://workflow`
**When** the resource is returned
**Then** it contains markdown documentation of the recommended 3-step workflow: find indicators → check temporal coverage → retrieve data (FR48)
**And** includes tips for using popular indicators and offline search

### Story 7.3: MCP Prompts & Resources Test Suite

As a developer,
I want automated tests for all prompts and resources,
So that I can verify they render correctly and return expected content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the test suite in `tests/mcp_server/`
**When** running prompts and resources tests
**Then** all tests pass

**Given** `test_prompts.py`
**When** tests run
**Then** it tests each prompt renders with required parameters
**And** tests default parameter values for `trend_analysis`
**And** tests that rendered prompts contain key workflow steps
**And** tests that prompts mention DATA_SOURCE citations

**Given** `test_resources.py`
